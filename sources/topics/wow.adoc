== Way of Working during practical hours.


image:tdd.png[float="right"] The way of working with the practical assignments is as follows:

* Each student has a personal subversion repository
* The teachers will add the starter project for the assignment in due time +
 to all student repositories, which are then available for checkout by the students
* The students will work on the assignment and work TDD style.
** Write a test for a requirement (typically a method), +
  see it showing failure ([red,bold]*RED*),
** then implement the method to turn the test [green,bold]*GREEN*.
** If [green,bold]*GREEN*, svn-commit both test-class AND implementing class.
* If the assignment is complete (all requirements covered with tests, all tests green and code coverage at an appropriate level )
  ask any of the teachers or student assistants to run the teachers test on your code.
** The teachers will not explicitly test your tests, only your implementation code, but will provide you with the test report.
** They will run *your* tests, to see if your test report is in agreement with the teachers tests.

This procedure is similar to the one followed during the link:2019/assessmentcorrectionrules.html[performance assessment] at the end of the semester.
The difference is that we will review not only the implementation, but will start with reviewing the tests.
If there is no valid test, the implementation of the method will not be considered.
