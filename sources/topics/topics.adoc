== Topics 2021

// TODO table below needs revision.

////
Focus points in the weeks ahead:
. week 1 Testing, JUnit5, assertJ
.. comparator will be a big part here?
.. experiment with various comp. impls inside test class.
.. use sorting as example. assertThat(x).containsExactly(...) and assertThat(x).containsExactlyInAnyOrder()
.. looking at assertThat().extract...
.. more exercises needed.
.. main exercise: fraction (), need more simpler ones.
. week 2 lambda
. week 3, need simpler in the pub. Also needs try with resources. (A tap is AutoClosable?).

In the topics table below, *Vol I* is _Core Java Volume I, Fundamentals_ and *Vol II* is _Core Java Volume II, Advanced Features_
both by Cay S. Horstmann and both in the eleventh edition.
